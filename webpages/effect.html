<h1 style="text-align:center"> What are the Effects of Video Games?  </h1>
<img src="file:///Users/priyanshbeniwal/Desktop/PP%20website%20/video-console.png" class="center" style="width:15%;">


<h3 style="text-align:center"> 1. Overall  Wellbeing </h3>
<p style="margin:60px"style="text-align:center"style="line-height:3.5em;">Games are really helpful in order to recover from trauma.
Playing video games can also be distractions from psychological problems and anxiety.
 Video games are also really good for development of one’s brain as it teaches people
That is how to deal with failures and come back.
 It boosts people’s minds and it is also really important for people to release some stress. </p>
<bR>
 <h3 style="text-align:center"> 2. Physical Wellbeing </h3>
 <p style="margin:60px" style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;">
    According to a survey conducted in Isfahan International School,
    it says that there is a direct relation between addiction to video games and negative impact on physical wellbeing.
    It has been proved that teenagers playing video games generally have high blood pressure and heart beat because while playing the game, they get emotional fluctuations. Sometimes, they get overexcited and sometimes they get stressed. Video games even cause addiction to dopamine as players enjoy the pleasure of winning a video game which is caused by dopamine in the body. Playing video games for an extended period of time can make you addicted to that chemical. Extended periods of gaming commonly causes obesity as the players, especially teenagers don’t burn their calories by working out instead they sit on the couch play video games for hours without even standing once.
    This activity causes obesity, constipation and future problems such as constipation. Excessive gaming has a lot of physical consequences such as carpal tunnel, migraines, backaches, sleep disorder, poor eating, poor hygeine.
    <br><br><b>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome:</b> <br><br>
    Carpal Tunnel syndrome is a disease which is related to excessive use of computer. As gaming requires intensive long sessions on your system so it's not a surprise that this
    disease has been troubling the gamers. It is caused mainly when the median nerve (main nerve between forearm and hand) is pressed. This happens when the area of the wrist that has main nerve and tendons (carpal tunnel) swells or irritates.
    Excessive use of a mouse or a gaming controller can cause these type of irritation and swellling.

  <br><br><b>Migraines:</b> <br><br>

Migraine is a type of headache that starts on a particular spot and it takes time to spread. As it spreads, it gets extremely painful during that period.
Occasionallly, the headache gets so painful that it causes the sufferer to vomit. Loud audio and visuals can cause intolerant pain. Someone whoselikes to play video games for
a longer period of time is prone to migraines. The gamer requires intense concentration while playing the video game which put strain on eyes. That strain causes migraine.

<br><br><b>Sleep Disorder:</b><br><br>
Sleep disorder, insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep apnea, nocturnal myoclonus (shaking of leg or arms during sleep) and parasomnia (sleepwalking, night talking and etc).
Sometimes people think too much about their game at night which causes overstimulation of brain. In short, you don't get a good sleep at night because you think too much of the game.
<br><br> Backaches<br><br>
Backaches are a very common symptom of excessive gaming.
When you play for hours seated on your chair without even moving, your back gets stiff and sore. This could also result into chronic problems.
<br><br>Poor Eating <br><br>
Most of the gamers suffer from eating irregularities. Sometimes, gamers skip their meals of the day because they are busy playing video games. When they eat, they eat very quickly without taking time. Rather than eating healthy, balanced meals, they consume food that is instant to cook.
Commonly, those kind of food options are unhealthy.
<br><br> Poor Hygeine<br><br>
An addicted gamer never takes time to properly take care of his/her body. He/she doesn't take proper showers, face-wash, and brush. It is simply not one of their priorities.

<h3 style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;"> 3. Behaviour </h3>
<p style="margin:60px" style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;">Video games make the person frustrated and angry which is then released on other people. It even causes maladaptive coping strategies in which the person will directly confront any problem and challenge that comes in front of him/her. It also leads to low-self esteem in which the person starts thinking in the negative way about himself/herself. Sometimes it will even cause preference for solitude where the player will only find a few things pleasant, interesting and good. Dr. Olson suggests that the games which are violent in nature are although disturbing but it makes them entirely separated from real life.<br><br>
  According to the facts, youth violence has declined over the years but number of violent games has increased significantly during that period. On the other hand, studies by low State University psychology researchers stated an evidence which speaks that youth
  who play social games in which character perform non violence activities can increase helpfulness and decrease hurtfull bheaviour.
  "One of the interesting findings among these 9- to 14-year-olds is that we show both effects [prosocial and violent] in the same study, relative to a neutral game," said Anderson, a leading researcher on the behavioral effects of video games on children. "In this paper, we have  focused more on the prosocial aspect, in part because that is newer. But this research shows that you can use the same kind of video game platform [as violent games], and if you have prosocial behaviors modeled in the game, you can increase the prosocial behavior just as many prior studies have shown that violent games increase antisocial behavior."<br>
  There was another new study conducted with 330 college students, It was supposed to be published in an issue of Aggresive Behavior.It concluded that playing non violent games helped the students to reduce their feelings of
  hostility and increased their positive effect. On the contrary, playing violent games had the exact opposity effects. Anderson also said that Video games are wonderful teachers and motivators, but content matters.
  This means that if the content is good then it will have positive effects. If the content is not appropriate then it will have the opposite effects.
 </p>
 <br>
<h3 style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;">4. Adolescence </h3>
<p style="margin:60px" style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;"> Adolescence and puberty are the most important part of  life.
  It changes their perspective about things and it shapes them for the future.
   Video games expose the adolescent teens to the aggressive and violent world outside. This makes the teens very friendly with the violence. It inserts the knowledge regarding violence in mind of a teenager.
  This alters their behavior and causes them to use the violent behavior. Adolescense is even affected by playing games which are not age appropriate.<br>
  Games like "GTA V" expose the teenagers to nudity, sexual violence and inappropriate language. This above 18 content interests the teenagers which provoke them to watch
  stuff like pornography. Consequences of excessive gaming is increased by the factor of adolescence.  Gamers who are going through this period have lower life satisfaction scores and high levels of negativity which results into depression and anxiety.

</p>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;"> 5. Memory </h3>
<p style="margin:60px" style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;">Most video games require amazing strategic and concentration skills. A really good example is when you play Minecraft. When you start exploring the world then you know how necessary it is to memorize that from where you claimed some specific resources. Exploring these types of virtual world games have a positive impact on peoples' memory. When you handle multiple types of tasks together in your mind then it helps warming up your hippocampus. This part of the brain helps you in the conversion of short-term memory to long-term memory.

<h3 style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;"> 6. Spatial Visualization </h3>
<p style="margin:60px" style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;">
  Visuospatial compentencies are "realm of cognitive ability". It helps the person to read, transform, interpret and generate  the non linguistic features quickly.
Before I explain about the positive effect on these factors. Let's look at the definition of these factors to understand their effects properly.
<br> <br> Spatial perception - the ability to evaluate and analyse the spatial relationships.<br>
Mental rotation - the ability to look at all the objects in 2D from a different angle and perspective. <br>
Spatial Visualization - the ability to perform multiple mental tasks of spatial information. <br>
Spatio temporal ability - the ability to make quick and accurate decisions about timings and movement of the objects. <br><br>
   In 2013, the American Psychological Association conducted a research study which concluded that shooting games improve the way humans visualize
3 Dimensional objects. Playing first person shooting video games improves your performance on the mental rotation task. Video Games develop your visuospatial competencies.
</p>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;"> 7. Perception Vision </h3>
<p style="margin:60px" style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;">In 2014, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America concluded that action video games can improve the perceptions that a person has. It doesn’t matter which situation. Another research conducted by the University of Rochester displayed that extended gaming hours improve contrast sensitivity of a person by around 40 percent.

<br>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align:center"> 8. Decision Making  </h3>
<p style="margin:60px" style="text-align:center">Racing games such as Forza Horizon and Asphalt which are fast paced are really for improving decision making skills because you don’t have enough time to think about the decisions, you have to make the right ones in a matter of seconds. University of Rochester conducted a study in 2010 which proved that people who are action game lovers make the right and accurate choice more often than the normal people who don’t play games.
</p>

<br>
<h3 style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;"> 9. Problem Solving </h3>
<p style="margin:60px" style="text-align:center"style="line-height:3.5em;" >Strategic and story mode games force you to solve complex problems in order to proceed ahead in the video game. A study by American Psychological Association in 2013 showed that teens who play problem solving games are excelling in their academics.
  They also help the gamer to  improve their reflexes as sometimes you have to be very quick in order to solve a puzzle in the game. Also, video games allow you to try out different things without costing you a lot.
  <br> These factors in video games allow you to improve your problem solving skills. <br><br>
<br><br>1. Learning from mistakes<br><br>
In video games, you are supposed to response really quickly to anything. For example: in a battle royale game,
you need to respond quickly to any attacks that are coming to you. Sometimes you become relentless which results into
you making a blunder and dying in the video game. You realize your mistake on spot in video games.
This helps you to learn from it so that you can make strategies the next time you are playing that game. <br>


<br><br>2. Practise makes perfect<br><br>
Gaming makes you go into an experience which is known as deep practise. In this experience, the gamer has to go through the period
in which he/she repeat something until they master that skill. For example, if someone is getting shot by their enemies at a certain point in the game then they will
keep getting the same result until they change their tactic. This Deep experience frustate the players however it is very helpful in problem solving. <br>


<br><br>3. Boost in creativity<br><br>
 Immersion plays the key role in this factor. When you play a game, you imerse yourself in it which allows your brain
 to form new connections and solve problems precisely. You need to perform multiple tasks in game in order to solve problems. <br>


<br><br>4. The idea of giving up<br><br>
Video games are great at teaching you the idea to give up. In video games, you have to try out new tactics and strategy everytime.
Sometimes those strategies don't work so you just give up for that period because you get a thought that you are wasting your time. this
flexibility is a key factor to solve complex problems.

<br><br>5. Trial and Error approach <br><br>
Video games allow the person to try out different things on a single platform.
 The player will keep trying till the last point to figure out the correct way. This approach is very useful in both real-life and virtual gaming world.
 This shows that video games are extremely useful to improve problem solving skills.

<h3 style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;"> 10. Mood </h3>
<p style="margin:60px" style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;">
  Games are often known as mood boosters as they make the person happy.
  A study conducted by the American Psychological Association displayed that arcade games like pacman and Angry Birds can boost a person’s mood.
  Gaming is very effective in altering the person's mood. Many studies state that playing video games reduce stress and improves mood.
  A person can experience range of emotions while playing video games including satisfaction, relaxation, frustation, and anger.
Gaming release dopamine in your body which provides you with the feeling of joy.
Dopamine is released a lot when you play games, that's why you feel the pleasure when
you play the video games. One study said that   "if playing video games simply makes people happier, this seems to be a fundamental emotional benefit to consider."
</p>

<br>
<h3 style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;"> 11. Social Skills </h3>
<p style="margin:60px" style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;">
There has been a debate about whether video games improve social skills or if it has a negative impact on social skills.
There are both sides of this topic. They improve their skills as around 70 percent of the games are played with their mates.
Also, the gaming community is very big and interactive. Social life has been widely affected by gaming. Gamers start going into social isolation where they ignore the activities which they used to enjoy previousely. They also prefer to
avoid socialising with people. This might result in irritability, anxiety and depression.

<h3 style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;">  12. Curiosity and Learning</h3>
<p style="margin:60px" style="text-align:center" style="line-height:3.5em;">
  Playing video games helps your brain to work and grow. As you complete games and solve puzzles, you realize that you are connecting many dots in your mind which are helping it to grow.
  If you are playing Grand Theft Auto then you can learn many unexplored things that you want to learn in your new life.
  Video games also has some psychological symptoms including maladaptive coping strategies, negative affectivity, preference for solitude, poor academic performance.
  These factors affect the curiosity and learning of a person.
